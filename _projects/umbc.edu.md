Worked with the Library and DoIT to:

- Audit 550 scattered subdomains dating back to the ’90s  
- Archive SEO-rich legacy sites and redirect into /archive/ paths  
- Model a new “Area of Study” taxonomy allowing multi-category assignments  
- Migrate 6,500 articles/posts into WordPress with rank-preserving redirects
