Led a full rewrite of the SearchProcessor, FilterManager and UIRenderer:

- Fixed infinite-loop and overfiltering issues when unchecking child degree types  
- Implemented programKey deduplication to surface distinct titles with multiple degree levels  
- Tuned relevance tie-breaking and added clear-all/reset behavior  
- Improved performance by lazy-loading filter logic and throttling DOM updates
